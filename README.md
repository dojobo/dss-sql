# Querying Databases with SQL

Spring 2020 workshop

Dominic Bordelon, Research Data Librarian, [Digital Scholarship Services](https://library.pitt.edu/digital-scholarship-services) (Pitt)

Relational databases play an important role in both academic research and data-driven industries, and the most common way to access them is using Structured Query Language (SQL). You don’t need to be a software developer to use it--many non-programming jobs view this skill as a plus, for example. In this workshop for absolute beginners, we’ll give an overview of how relational databases work, and how to query them using SQL.

## Setup
* Download and install/run [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
* Download the [Chinook SQLite database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/raw/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite) by [Luis Rocha](https://github.com/lerocha)
* Download the ["Portal all" database](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11188550) from [Data Carpentry for Biologists](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/materials/datasets/)
